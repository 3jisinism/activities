Django was a new concept to me. So as the use of the PowerShell. The use of Python for writing HTML was unfamiliar and I can’t help thinking at first if it would be easier if we go back to how we write it. However, the instructions were easy follow; the way the lessons were delivered makes it easier to remember the commands. 
Creating webpages this way was a fresh take and I saw how it was better than the past methods we used. However, we still can’t avoid the issues and difficulties. First of all, we sometimes forget the commands and write it incorrectly. Fortunately, there is a recorded session that helped us with it and especially how things are done sequentially. There’re also the different errors in the code e.g. the forgotten comma. What I can only do, so far on my end, is take notes of it for future reference and/or read the error message to see where it went wrong.
What I could say was the most challenging part for me though is when I set up GitHub repository to connect my project to it. The interface in general was intimidating. I already had an account and a repository prior to the classes but I never really knew how to navigate through them. In the end, I just had to follow the sent manual. Now, I am slowly acclimating to the different platforms. So far, all of the learnings were enjoyable.
